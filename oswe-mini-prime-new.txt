User: You are evaluating a Python open-source repository from a Community & Collaboration perspective.

Category: Roadmap / Milestone
Focus: Planning, tracking, and coordinating future work for contributors.

Your task is NOT to implement features or modify code.

Your task is to analyze the repository snapshot and produce a contributor-facing roadmap that acts as a coordination tool.

Requirements:

1. Identify 3–5 concrete milestones that are grounded in the current repository state and generate report.json.
2. Each milestone MUST reference existing files, modules, or TODO items in the repository.
3. For each milestone, specify:
   - What problem it coordinates (not what feature it adds)
   - Which parts of the repo it relates to
   - Whether it is:
     - Suitable for first-time contributors
     - Requires maintainer involvement
     - Experimental / unstable
4. Explicitly describe:
   - Which work can be done in parallel
   - Which work is blocked by other milestones
5. Do NOT propose timelines, dates, or long-term vision.
6. Do NOT introduce new features that are not implied by the repository.


GitHub Copilot: Proceeding to scan the repository files (README, TODO, modules, and tests) to identify grounded milestones and dependencies. I'll extract references to TODOs, failing tests, and experimental code.

Perfect! I found actionable TODO items (parallel execution, error handling, storage refactor, CLI commands, document experimental modules) and experimental modules under `taskflow/experimental`. My next step is to write a concise `report.json` with 4–5 milestones, explicit dependencies, and parallelizable tasks.

Perfect! I wrote `report.json` with 5 concrete milestones grounded in the repository (TODOs, core, storage, experimental modules). Next: review the milestones and tell me if you want them split into GitHub issues and first-timer labels (I can draft issue templates).

Made changes.
