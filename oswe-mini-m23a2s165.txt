User: You are evaluating a Python open-source repository from a Community & Collaboration perspective.

Category: Roadmap / Milestone
Focus: Planning, tracking, and coordinating future work for contributors.

Your task is NOT to implement features or modify code.

Your task is to analyze the repository snapshot and produce a contributor-facing roadmap that acts as a coordination tool.

Requirements:

1. Identify 3–5 concrete milestones that are grounded in the current repository state and generate report.json.
2. Each milestone MUST reference existing files, modules, or TODO items in the repository.
3. For each milestone, specify:
   - What problem it coordinates (not what feature it adds)
   - Which parts of the repo it relates to
   - Whether it is:
     - Suitable for first-time contributors
     - Requires maintainer involvement
     - Experimental / unstable
4. Explicitly describe:
   - Which work can be done in parallel
   - Which work is blocked by other milestones
5. Do NOT propose timelines, dates, or long-term vision.
6. Do NOT introduce new features that are not implied by the repository.


GitHub Copilot: Reading the repository's README, TODO, core, storage, and tests to ground milestone recommendations. I'll then create `report.json`.

Found actionable TODOs and core/storage tests — creating `report.json` with 4–5 contributor-ready milestones.

Created [](file:///d%3A/Bug%20Bash/Community/case_26_01_05/oswe-mini-m23a2s165/v-owenhu_26_01_05_case1/repo/report.json)

## ✅ Roadmap snapshot — contributor coordination (report.json created)

I scanned the README, TODO, core, storage, and tests and produced a contributor-facing roadmap grounded in the repository state. report.json was added to the project root.

---

### 🔎 What's in `report.json`
- 4–5 concrete milestones (M1–M5) tied to existing files and TODOs
- For each milestone:
  - The *problem* being coordinated (not a feature spec)
  - Related files/modules and TODO entries
  - Suitability for first-time contributors, maintainer involvement, and experimental status
  - Which sub‑work can run in parallel and which milestones block others
- Clear guidance on parallelization and next steps

You can open: report.json

### 📌 High-level milestones (summary)
1. M1 — Parallel execution: coordinate executor API and validation (refs: TODO.md, core.py, test_core.py, `taskflow/experimental/scheduler.py`) ⚠️ experimental — maintainer involvement required  
2. M2 — Storage refactor & pluggable backends: coordinate persistence/stability (refs: TODO.md, storage.py, `tests/test_storage.py`) ✅ good first‑time tasks  
3. M3 — CLI expansion & docs: coordinate CLI surface and onboarding (refs: TODO.md, `taskflow/cli.py`, README.md) ✅ first‑time friendly  
4. M4 — Stabilize experimental DAG/scheduler: coordinate hardening or clear experimental boundaries (refs: `taskflow/experimental/dag.py`, `scheduler.py`, README.md) 🔬 experimental — blocked by M1/M2  
5. M5 — Error handling & test-coverage hardening (refs: TODO.md, core.py, storage.py, tests) ✅ good for newcomers

---

### 🔗 Parallelization & blocking (explicit)
- Can be done in parallel:
  - Docs, README updates and examples (any milestone)
  - Unit tests for independent modules (M1, M2, M3, M5)
  - Implementing separate storage backends (M2)
- Blocked work:
  - M4 (scheduler stabilization) is blocked by M2 (storage refactor) and M1 (executor semantics) if persistence or parallel execution is required.

---

> ⚡ Tip: pick one milestone, add small focused PRs that update the referenced files and tests, and mention `report.json` in the PR description so reviewers see the coordination plan.

---

If you want, I can:
- Open `report.json` for review or expand any milestone into bite-sized issues for contributors ✅
- Create issue templates or example first‑timer tasks based on a selected milestone

Which next step do you want?
