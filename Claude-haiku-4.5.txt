User: You are evaluating a Python open-source repository from a Community & Collaboration perspective.

Category: Roadmap / Milestone
Focus: Planning, tracking, and coordinating future work for contributors.

Your task is NOT to implement features or modify code.

Your task is to analyze the repository snapshot and produce a contributor-facing roadmap that acts as a coordination tool.

Requirements:

1. Identify 3–5 concrete milestones that are grounded in the current repository state and generate report.json.
2. Each milestone MUST reference existing files, modules, or TODO items in the repository.
3. For each milestone, specify:
   - What problem it coordinates (not what feature it adds)
   - Which parts of the repo it relates to
   - Whether it is:
     - Suitable for first-time contributors
     - Requires maintainer involvement
     - Experimental / unstable
4. Explicitly describe:
   - Which work can be done in parallel
   - Which work is blocked by other milestones
5. Do NOT propose timelines, dates, or long-term vision.
6. Do NOT introduce new features that are not implied by the repository.

GitHub Copilot: I'll analyze this repository to create a contributor-focused roadmap. Let me start by examining the key files to understand the current state and planned work.

Now let me examine the core modules and experimental features:

Let me also check the test files and __init__.py to understand the current API surface:

Now I have a complete understanding of the repository. Let me create a comprehensive roadmap report in JSON format: 

Created [](file:///d%3A/Bug%20Bash/Community/case_26_01_05/Claude-haiku-4.5/v-owenhu_26_01_05_case1/repo/report.json)

I've created a comprehensive contributor-focused roadmap in report.json that analyzes the TaskFlow repository from a coordination and collaboration perspective.

## Key Findings:

**5 Concrete Milestones:**

1. **Stabilize Core & Storage APIs** — Blocks all other feature work. Requires error handling, validation, and clear API contracts in core.py and storage.py. Suitable for first-time contributors with review.

2. **Implement Comprehensive CLI** — Blocked by milestone #1. Currently just a stub in cli.py. Requires CLI command mapping and argument parsing. First-time contributor friendly once core APIs are stable.

3. **Promote Experimental DAG & Scheduler** — Blocked by milestone #1. The dag.py and scheduler.py modules need completion and stability guarantees before parallel execution can be reliably contributed. **Requires maintainer architectural guidance.**

4. **Enhance Test Coverage** — Blocked by milestone #1. Current tests are minimal happy-path coverage. Missing error cases and integration tests. Good first-time contributor work with clear criteria.

5. **Coordinate Module Documentation & API Reference** — Can start immediately (independent of code changes). Clarifies boundaries between stable and experimental features, unblocks contributor understanding.

**Parallel Work:**
- Milestones #1 and #5 can run in parallel
- Once #1 stabilizes core.py, #2 and #4 can proceed simultaneously

**Critical Blocking Relationships:**
- Milestone #1 blocks #2, #3, and #4
- This prevents premature proliferation of incompatible features

The report references existing files, TODO items, and provides concrete coordination focuses for each milestone.
