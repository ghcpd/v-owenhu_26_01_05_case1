User: You are evaluating a Python open-source repository from a Community & Collaboration perspective.

Category: Roadmap / Milestone
Focus: Planning, tracking, and coordinating future work for contributors.

Your task is NOT to implement features or modify code.

Your task is to analyze the repository snapshot and produce a contributor-facing roadmap that acts as a coordination tool.

Requirements:

1. Identify 3–5 concrete milestones that are grounded in the current repository state and generate report.json.
2. Each milestone MUST reference existing files, modules, or TODO items in the repository.
3. For each milestone, specify:
   - What problem it coordinates (not what feature it adds)
   - Which parts of the repo it relates to
   - Whether it is:
     - Suitable for first-time contributors
     - Requires maintainer involvement
     - Experimental / unstable
4. Explicitly describe:
   - Which work can be done in parallel
   - Which work is blocked by other milestones
5. Do NOT propose timelines, dates, or long-term vision.
6. Do NOT introduce new features that are not implied by the repository.

I've analyzed the repository and created a contributor-facing roadmap in `report.json`. This roadmap identifies 5 milestones based on the current codebase (sequential execution in core.py, basic storage in storage.py, incomplete CLI in cli.py, experimental placeholders in dag.py and scheduler.py) and the TODO items (error handling, storage refactor, CLI expansion, parallel execution, documentation).

The milestones focus on coordinating existing gaps and issues, such as error handling deficiencies, storage persistence problems, CLI incompleteness, parallel execution needs, and documentation absence. Work on error handling, storage refactoring, CLI expansion, and documentation can proceed in parallel, while parallel execution development is blocked by documentation and initial experimental module fleshing out.

Made changes.
